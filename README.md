# CoroNET

CoroNet is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model that uses chest X-ray images to diagnose Covid-19 infection. CoroNet, a deep learning algorithm, was learned and validated on a dataset compiled from Covid-19 and other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two publicly accessible datasets. According to preliminary data, CoroNet obtained an average accuracy of 89.5 percent, with precision and recall rates for Covid-19 events of 97 percent and 100 percent, respectively. The early findings of this analysis are positive, and further training evidence will be accessible as time goes by.
